## Installation

With [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) installed in your machine,
```shell
npm install -g projectman
```

---

## Commands
`pm` is an alias of `projectman` so you can use `pm <command>` or `projectman <command>`

### Open Project

Opens project in your code editor (Check out [`pm seteditor`](#set-editor) command to set your preferred editor)

**Usage :** 
```shell
pm open [projectName]
```
`[projectName]` is an optional parameter.

**Alias:** `pm o`, `pm`

### Add Project or Template

Add project to favorites

```shell
cd /till/the/project
pm add
```

*You can pass `--url` param to add a URL instead of a directory.*

### Create Project

Use added projects as a template to create new project

```shell
pm create
```

**Alias:** `pm c`

### Set Editor

```shell
pm seteditor
```
Sets default editor to open projects from.

To set a different editor for a specific project,

**Flag:** `--for-project`
```shell
pm seteditor --for-project
```
Sets different editor for a specific project.
E.g You can use VSCode for other projects and Atom for `CoolProject1`

If your TextEditor/IDE is not listed, You can select option `Other` from the list and give your `editorCommand`.
Read [editorCommand ref](#settings-ref) for more information.


### `cd` to a project without opening.
```shell
cd $(pm getpath [projectName])
```

`[projectName]` is an optional parameter.

**Alias :** `cd $(pm gp)`

(Note: This does not work in Windows cmd, You can use it in Windows Powershell)

### Remove Project
```shell
pm remove
```
Removes project from favorites.

### Remove editor
```shell
pm rmeditor
```
Shows list of project and removes the project specific editor from the project.

```shell
pm rmeditor --all
```

## Settings.json

If you want to sort projects/change name of project/change path, You can type `pm edit` to open settings.json


#### Example settings:
```json
{
    "commandToOpen": "code",
    "projects": [
        {
            "name": "Project1",
            "path": "path/to/project1"
        },
        {
            "name": "Project2",
            "path": "path/to/project2",
            "editor": "atom"
        },
        {
            "name": "Project3",
            "path": "path/to/project3"
        }
    ]
}
```
This will show three projects in `pm open` and project2 will be opened in Atom and other projects will be opened in Visual Studio Code


#### Settings Ref:

**> commandToOpen** :
- This is your editor's command, this command will be used to open the file in your editor.
- Default is `code` which opens in vscode.
- This is the command that you normally use to open directories in your editor.

| Editor        |'commandToOpen' value|
|---------------|-----------|
| **VSCode**    | code      | 
| **Atom**      | atom      | 
| **Sublime**   | subl      | 
| **Vim**       | vim       | 
| **WebStorm**  | wstorm    |

**> projects.`name` :**
- This is the name that will be visible when you type `projectman open`

**> projects.`path` :**
- This should be the absolute path to your folder.

**> projects.`editor` :**
- This is optional key. In case it doesn't exist it will read value from `commandToOpen` 
- You can use this to specify separate editor for a particular project.
